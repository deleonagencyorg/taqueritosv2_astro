For the second consecutive year, Yummies was recognized as the number one snack brand in the minds of Hondurans, according to the Top of Mind 2025 study conducted by Estrategia & Negocios and Kantar Mercaplan. The award was received by **Luis Weddle**, Snacks Category Manager, who highlighted that this achievement reflects more than five decades of commitment, flavor, innovation, and connection with consumers.
